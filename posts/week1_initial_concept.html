    <h1>Week 1: Initial Concepts and Site Creation</h1>
    <p class="post-date">Posted on September 15, 2024</p>
    <p>
        For the first week of the blog, I wanted to emphasize that I started working on this idea a few weeks prior. I have always wanted to start my own world building project and as such, this is the culmination of my original ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the actual initial concept, I started with coming up with the main theme and idea behind Discernius. Upon branching out I decided to start devling into one of the major groups within. I will go more in-depth on this group later.
    </p>
	<p>
		Truth be told, I put a hold on the project after day one until today, September 15th where I decided to pick it up once more and officiate it through the means of this blog/website. As I progress, I hope to continue my weekly documentations each Sunday!
	</p>
	<p>
		Before I finish, I would like to state that I have a goal in mind with this website. As I progress, I plan to eventually turn it into a personal wiki of sorts to document Discernius as time goes on. I wonder what the first few documentations will be . . .
	</p>
    <p>
		That being said, I end this first post here! Have a happy Sunday! (~ Yunasoda)
